# Scripts & Tips I've used to successfully migrate from SVN to Git

## Usage

[`git-svn-import.sh`](https://github.com/stevenharman/git-svn-import/blob/master/git-svn-clone-externals.sh)
is the heart of this beast. Therein you'll find a handful of `git` sub-commands
that can be used to import your SVN repositories. It helps to think of that file
as a recipe for how you might do your own import, filling in your details as
needed.

If you're up for, I'd love to make it more automated...
